columns to be dropped = findex2, findex9
drop findex2
ignore 4444, findex1, findex2, findex9 columns
remove 9999 column
drop columns 9999, 4444
drop column 9999dr
delete column1, column4 and column6
not consider price, sales
features to be ignored = weight, height, length
not use distance and velocity for train the model
eliminate column1 and column2 from data set
hide attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 , attribute 4 and attribute 5 from learning
normalize 4444 and 9999 in data set
apply normalization to col1, col2 by using scaler
normalize feature 1, feature 2 and feature 3 by using scale of 0 to 10
normalize column1 and column 5 in uploaded dataset
columns to be normalized = 3, 4
apply normalization to column1 and column2
features to be normalized = name, age, place
normalize attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 and attribute 5
use attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 , attribute 4 and attribute 5 for learning
features to be used to learn = weight, height, length
selected features = 9999, 4444
use 4444, findex1, findex2, findex9 columns
columns to be considered = findex2, findex9
attributes are column 1 , column 2 and column 6
features = runs, wickets, no_of_100's, average, strke_rates
numerize 4444 and 9999 in data set
numerize column1 and column 5 in uploaded dataset
numerize attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 and attribute 5
features to be numerized = name, age, place
apply numerization to column1 and column2
numerize column1 to column 5
columns to be numerized = 3, 4

define variable le and instantiate label encoder
define variable scaler and assign standard scaler class
use attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 , attribute 4 and attribute 5 for learning
features to be used to learn = weight, height, length
selected features = 9999, 4444
use 4444, findex1, findex2, findex9 columns
columns to be considered = findex2, findex9
attributes are column 1 , column 2 and column 6
features = runs, wickets, no_of_100's, average, strke_rates
use knn from the machine learning package
import k-means from ML library
import KNN
import NN from Machine Learning library
import library SVM

import k-nearest neghbour library
numerize 4444 and 9999 in data set
numerize column1 and column 5 in uploaded dataset
numerize attribute 1, attribute 2, attribute 3 and attribute 5
features to be numerized = name, age, place
apply numerization to column1 and column2
numerize column1 to column 5
columns to be numerized = 3, 4
use learned model to predict feature for my_list
predict relevant class for dp
apply sample_data to the model and obtain class
find class for given data points in array employees
predict clf for new_datapoint
parse list_values to model and obtain predicted classes
fill incomplete values by using locf
replace values for unfilled cells from nocf
remove null values in column4 by using column average
replace NaN values with next observation carried forawrd
replace Null values with last observation carried forawrd
replace empty values with the column mean and reassign dataframe
put train and test sets in to separate data frames
fill empty array temp with name, age and weight
add 49, 45 to array iop
ruplef is a list with values computer, phone, book, 465, and 244.43
define a string array called str_array and put flowers, guitars, elephants and drums to it
num_array = Arshad, Milan
create a list named temp_list and add 'Milan', 'Madusha', 'Dinusha', 'Arshad', 'Ruchira'
assign 45, 89 ,45 ,12 and 44 to number_array
my_list.append(runs, wickets, total, strike_rate)
add element1 to element_list
append age, height, skills to the list named my_list
initialize a for each loop for items in the list my_array
for element in given_list
for every k in keys
for e in elements :
for item in item_list
apply for every member in the given_list
do to each item in the my_list
iterate through each member in the array
iterate for each column in the dataset,
